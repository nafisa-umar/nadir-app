# NADIR WEBSITE  

### An informative website on a community service forum being developed by Nile Students for Nile Students.  
Using template by [briancodex](https://github.com/briancodex/react-website-styled-components-v1).  

## What is Nadir?  

Nadir is a chat platform for students to come together and plan community development projects instead of complaining while getting nothing done. 
Nadir is currently preparing for its first stage of testing on the Nile University of Nigeria campus. Our plan is to cultivate a habit of volunteering and
changemaking in students in Abuja, and subsequently Nigeria.  
This [project](https://nafisa-umar.github.io/nadir-app/) is an attempt to shed more light on Nadir.

I hope you like it and join us on our journey :)
